Estimation of Reference Evapotranspiration(ET0)-By using Penman-Monteith method

Reference Evapotranspiration (ET₀)
Reference Evapotranspiration (ET₀) is a measure of the amount of water that would be evaporated and transpired by a standardized reference crop, typically a well-watered grass, under ideal conditions. It is a key parameter in hydrology, agriculture, and environmental studies for estimating water requirements for crops and managing irrigation.

Key Points:
Purpose: ET₀ helps in understanding the potential evaporation and transpiration from a reference crop, which is essential for irrigation scheduling and water resource management.
Calculation: It is calculated using meteorological data such as temperature, humidity, solar radiation, and wind speed. The Penman-Monteith equation is commonly used for this purpose.
Importance: Accurate ET₀ estimation helps in determining the water needs of different crops, optimizing irrigation practices, and managing water resources efficiently.
For detailed calculations and analysis, this project uses meteorological data to estimate ET₀ for specific days and months, visualizing the results to aid in practical applications.
